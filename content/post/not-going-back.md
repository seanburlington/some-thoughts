We'd had some frustrations with school (and some school refusal) then schools closed for lockdown.

Home education worked for us and we decided not to go back.

The boy loves maths, I mean he'd usually rather play Minecraft, but it isn't hard to get him interested in fractions, percentages, or algebra.

The problem with school is that it has to teach at a level that is the same for 30 kids in class and he wasn't allowed to skip ahead or spend longer exploring a topic of interest.

He was bored, he started to hate maths.

But he doesn't like writing - and we felt school was confirming this dislike through the obsession with SPAG.

We did send him back for the term schools were open between lockdowns - having been isolated for a few months he was happy to see his friends at first but soon the old frustrations resurfaced.

Schools closed again, and when the re-opened we decided not to send him back.

He has loads of clubs now and a really active lifestyle with learning tailored to him.

We're working hard to inspire him to a love of writing.

His love of maths, science, and History is strong

It is going well.
